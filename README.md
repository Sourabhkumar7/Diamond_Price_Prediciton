# This is my end to end Diamond Price prediction project.......
Welcome to my Diamond Price Prediction project! In this end-to-end endeavor, I tackled the challenging task of forecasting diamond prices. The project involves cleaning and refining the diamond dataset to ensure its accuracy. I visualized and analyzed the data, drawing meaningful conclusions to gain valuable insights. The predictive power comes from a sophisticated machine learning algorithm, providing precise diamond price predictions. Taking it a step further, I've seamlessly deployed the model on AWS for real-world accessibility and scalability.

Key Steps
Data Cleaning: I meticulously cleaned and refined the diamond dataset, eliminating messy and unwanted data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized and analyzed the data to draw insightful conclusions, shedding light on essential patterns.
Machine Learning Model: Developed and fine-tuned a supervised learning algorithm to predict diamond prices accurately.
AWS Deployment: Seamlessly deployed the predictive model on AWS, ensuring accessibility and scalability for practical applications.
